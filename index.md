Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun.

Having almost no atmosphere to retain heat,
it has surface temperatures that vary diurnally more than on any other planet in the Solar System, 
ranging from 100 K (−173 °C; −280 °F) at night to 700 K (427 °C; 800 °F) during the day across the equatorial regions.

Mercury is one of four terrestrial planets in the Solar System, and is a rocky body like Earth. 
It is the smallest planet in the Solar System, with an equatorial radius of 2,439.7 kilometres (1,516.0 mi).
Mercury is also smaller—albeit more massive—than the largest natural satellites in the Solar System, Ganymede and Titan. 
Mercury consists of approximately 70% metallic and 30% silicate material.

Mercury distance from earth is 210.42 million km
